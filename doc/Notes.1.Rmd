Downloaded FASTQ file from Basespace using basemount (direct download does not work in Linux). Using a modified Snakemake file copied from another project (trypseq). Starting routine analysis. Created conda environment with (hopefully) all necessary packages. Running snakamake. 

Oh joy of joys. I've recently upgraded to R 3.6, which means that now I need to re-install all the libraries. This takes time...
